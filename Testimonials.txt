Central City Police Department
Quality little machines.  Ready in seconds and easy to opperate.

Wellsworth Police Department
In 2015, we purchased the Urban model, to replace our previous robot, which was unfortunatly blown up during a routine test.  We soon found this robot to be far superiour to out previous robot.  The sensors are much stronger and the arms are set up for much finer movements, to allow for very percise movements.

Honor√© Police Department
A great little machine.  We purchased the jungle model so we could use it out in the rough terain of the Island.  Works like a charm.

Gotham Police Department
A fine piece of work.  We have gotten 3 of these urban machines to help grow out police force, and to always be ready for the next situation.

Jingletown Police Department
Gets the job done.  The instructions were clear and the support team was quite helpful in getting parts we needed replaced.  Great machine, would buy again.

Coruscant Guard
A real pleasure to use these.  We've used these to stop more threats than I can remember.  They always get the job done.

Llaniog Police Department
We purchased the urban model incase anything happens.  Thankfully, we've had no need to use it, though it is always quite reliable when we take it out for a test run.

Hill Valley Police Department
A nice machine.  Easy to handle and gets the job done.  Would highly recomend.

Mayberry Police Department
Great addition to the force.  We haven't any real emergancies for it it yet, but it is fun to drive around the town.

Starling City Police Department
It seems the world just keeps getting crazier, so we invested in two of the urban models.  They work great, and the lifetime warranties are great for us as we seem to have a lot of big threats here that could easily go wrong.
